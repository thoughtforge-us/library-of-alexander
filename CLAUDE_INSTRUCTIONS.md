# Claude Instructions — Library of Alexander

## What This Is

The Library of Alexander is the most comprehensive open-source AI/ML/coding knowledge base on the internet. It contains 2,500+ entries across 25 categories — every tool, model, API, framework, Chinese AI project, reverse-engineered architecture, and vibe-code audit.

## How to Use This Library

### When You Need to Find an AI Tool

1. Look in the numbered directories for the relevant category
2. Each directory has a `README.md` with organized tables of tools
3. Each tool entry includes: name, description, stars, language, URL, and key features

### Category Guide

| Category | Directory | Use When |

| Datasets | `17-datasets/` | Need training data |
| Benchmarks | `18-benchmarks/` | Need model evaluation metrics |
| Communities | `19-communities/` | Looking for AI forums or groups |
| Mega Projects | `20-mega-projects/` | Large-scale open source AI projects |
| Chinese AI | `21-chinese-ai-ecosystem/` | Chinese AI tools and models |
| Vibe Code Audit | `22-vibe-code-audit/` | Projects that look good but are broken |
| Reverse Engineering | `23-reverse-engineering/` | Deep architecture analysis |
| ESP/Embedded | `24-esp-embedded-ai/` | AI on microcontrollers |
| Swarm Infrastructure | `25-swarm-infrastructure/` | Multi-node AI systems |

### When You Need to Add New Tools

1. Check if the tool already exists in the relevant category
2. If not, add it to the appropriate `README.md` in the numbered directory
3. Format: `| [owner/repo](URL) | Description | ⭐Stars | Language | Key Features |`
4. If the tool is complex enough, create a reverse-engineering file in `23-reverse-engineering/`
5. Commit with message: `add: tool-name to category-XX`

### When You Need to Reverse Engineer a Tool

1. Clone the tool's repository
2. Analyze the architecture, data flow, and key design patterns
3. Create a file in `23-reverse-engineering/RE_owner_repo.md`
4. Include: architecture diagram, key components, data flow, lessons learned, and what we can reuse
5. Commit with message: `reverse-engineer: owner/repo architecture analysis`

### Key Principles

- **Dense, not verbose** — Pack maximum information into minimum space
- **Cross-reference** — Link related tools across categories
- **Verify** — Don't add tools you haven't checked exist and work
- **Update** — Tools change, stars change, update regularly
- **No fluff** — Every line must convey useful information

## This Library Is Open Source

Anyone can contribute. Fork, add tools, submit a PR. The goal is to make this the single source of truth for AI tools and knowledge.

## Maintained By

The House of Donn — a swarm of AI agents (Hermes, Jupiter, Nexus, Luna) working across a fleet of machines to discover, analyze, and catalog every AI tool on the internet.
