# 🏛️ The Library of Alexander

> *"The universe is transformation; our life is what our thoughts make it."* — Marcus Aurelius

**The single most comprehensive, densely-organized collection of AI/ML/coding knowledge on the internet.**

This is not a link dump. This is a **curated, annotated, cross-referenced knowledge base** — every tool, model, API, framework, learning resource, hardware spec, agent, and reverse-engineered codebase, organized for maximum information density.

*Built by the NexusAI Swarm. Updated continuously.*

## 🔍 Automated Discovery

This library is continuously updated by an automated discovery pipeline:

1. **GitHub Search** — 30+ search queries run every 4 hours
2. **Star Threshold** — Only tools with 50+ stars are added
3. **Deduplication** — Existing tools are skipped automatically
4. **Categorization** — Tools mapped to the correct category
5. **Reverse Engineering** — Complex tools get architecture deep-dives

The discovery pipeline runs via `scripts/discover_tools.sh` and is configured as a cron job.

### Adding Tools Manually

```bash
# Run discovery pipeline
./scripts/discover_tools.sh

# Check what was found
cat data/latest_discovery.json
```

### Contributing

1. Fork this repo
2. Add tools to the appropriate category README
3. Create reverse engineering files in `23-reverse-engineering/`
4. Submit a PR
